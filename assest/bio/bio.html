<p>Thandiswa has been one of the most influential singers in South Africa for the past 27 years. She began her career in 1996 with music groups Jack Knife and Bongo Maffin, one of the pioneering bands of the post-Apartheid dance music genre Kwaito. After 6 award-winning albums with Bongo Maffin she ventured onto a solo career.</p>

<p>Her first project 'Zabalaza' (2004), reached double platinum status and won numerous awards including a Kora award for Best African Female Artist and Four South African Music Awards. It was also nominated for the BBC Radio 3 Planet Awards. Her critically acclaimed second album 'Ibokwe' (2009) reached gold status in the first few weeks of its release and her live DVD 'Dance of the Forgotten Free' (2010) won South African Music Awards for Best Female Artist and Best Live DVD in 2011.  Thandiswa's third album Belede (2016) reached gold status within a few weeks of release</p>

<p>Born in the year of the Soweto Uprising (1976), she has always felt that she has the soul of a rebel. Both her parents were journalists and political activists and she was raised in a home filled with books and thick with political discussions. It was this environment that nurtured her perspective as an artist. Her work has always been inspired by the writings of people like Biko and Fanon, Achebe and Nkrumah, she says, "My work gave me an opportunity to share my thoughts and have a meaningful conversation with my generation about Blackness, Africaness, about some of the social ills that plague us, and also about freedom and joy. Music gave me an opportunity to feed my revolutionary self." Her music travels travels through the village into the ghetto and raises the roof in the city. Her compositions today include traditional Xhosa rhythms, mbaqanga, reggae, kwaito, funk and jazz. Through this, Thandiswa straddles the urban and the rural, effortlessly melding the traditional with the modern.</p>

<p>And it is with this spirit that Thandiswa has performed all over the world at venues including: the FIFA 2010 World Cup Opening Ceremony, The Apollo Theatre, Radio City Hall, Womex, The Cannes Film Festival, The Barbican, Africa Brazil Festival, Fespaco Film Festival, BBC World Music Awards, and Carnegie Hall citywide Festival among others. Thandiswa has collaborated with several musicians like Hugh Masekela, Busi Mhlongo, Paul Simon, the BLK JKS, DJ Black Coffee, Meshell Ndegeocello, Somi, Fatoumata Diawara, among others.</p>
 
<p>Her 4th Album, Sankofa, is due for release in early 2024. Recorded in Johannesburg, Dakar, and New York, it samples archival Xhosa music, combines jazz and west African music, and includes collaborations with Meshell Ndegeocello, Nduduzo Makhatini, and Thandi Ntuli.</p>
