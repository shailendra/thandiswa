<p>Thandiswa’s parents were journalists and political activists and she was raised in a home filled with books and thick with political discussions. It was this environment that nurtured her perspective as an artist. Her work has always been inspired by the writings of people like Biko and Fanon, Achebe and Nkrumah, she says, "My work gave me an opportunity to share my thoughts and have a meaningful conversation with my generation about Blackness, Africanness, about some of the social ills that plague us, and also about freedom and joy. Music gave me an opportunity to feed my revolutionary self." Her music travels travels through the village into the ghetto and raises the roof in the city. Her compositions today include traditional Xhosa rhythms, mbaqanga, reggae, kwaito, funk and jazz. Through this, Thandiswa straddles the urban and the rural, effortlessly melding the traditional with the modern.
